I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in Robotics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. Maani Ghaffari. My work bridges the **mathematics of AI** and **network design on geometric structures** for reliable, efficient robotics.

**Interests:** PEFT (LoRA/Quantization), **geometric** & equivariant learning (Lie groups/algebras), **sparsity**, **quantization**, and efficient structured matrices.

**Experience:** Visual SLAM Intern @ Bear Robotics; Vison/Language AI Researcher @ Intellicon Metalab Inc.

**Education:** B.S. in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University (2022).
