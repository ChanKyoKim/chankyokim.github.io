I’m a Ph.D. student in Robotics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. Maani Ghaffari.

My research interests are at the intersection of robotics, geometric deep learning, and model efficiency. I develop robust and scalable AI systems by building foundational methods in:

Geometric & Equivariant AI: Leveraging principles from Lie Group theory to create architectures with strong generalization properties.

Efficient Deep Learning: Exploring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), model compression (quantization, sparsity), and efficient structured matrices to make large models practical for real-world robotics.

I was previously an AI Research Engineer at Intellicon Metalab Inc. and received my B.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Seoul National University in 2022.
